# Four keywords of OOP

- Abstraction (process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the functionality to the user, the user will only know “what it does” rather than “how it does”.)

- Encapsulation (Prevents you from seeing or caring about the internal workings of an implementation, the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.)

- Inheritance (the process of one class inheriting properties and methods from another class, "extends" keyword )

- Polymorphish (the ability to perform many things in many ways. The word Polymorphism is many forms )
